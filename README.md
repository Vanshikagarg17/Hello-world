About Repository
1. What is a repository?
A repository is like a folder for your project. Your project's repository contains all of your project's files and stores each file's revision history. You can also discuss and manage your project's work within the repository.

2. Repository visibility?
You can restrict who has access to a repository by choosing a repository's visibility: public, internal, or private.

3. How to create a new repository?
You can create a new repository on your personal account or any organization where you have sufficient permissions. You can generate a new repository with the same directory structure and files as an existing repository.
