About Repository


1. What is a repository?

A repository is like a folder for your project. Your project's repository contains all of your project's files and stores each file's revision history. You can also discuss and manage your project's work within the repository.



2. Repository visibility

You can restrict who has access to a repository by choosing a repository's visibility: public, internal, or private.



3. Create a new repository

You can create a new repository on your personal account or any organization where you have sufficient permissions. You can generate a new repository with the same directory structure and files as an existing repository.



4. Creating a template repository

You can make an existing repository a template, so you and others can generate new repositories with the same directory structure, branches, and files.



5. Duplicating a repository

To duplicate a repository without forking it, you can run a special clone command, then mirror-push to the new repository.
